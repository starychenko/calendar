## Project Overview

This is a Ukrainian fiscal calendar web application built with Next.js 16 (App Router) that displays week numbers using both ISO 8601 and GfK methodologies, along with Ukrainian holidays. The application includes comprehensive SEO optimization, PWA support, and a clean, modern UI.

### Tech Stack
- **Next.js 16** with App Router and Turbopack
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling
- **shadcn/ui** components (New York style)
- **date-fns v4** for date manipulation
- **TanStack Query v5** for state management (configured in app/providers.tsx)
- **Zustand** with persist middleware for global state (calendar mode, year, navigation visibility, theme preference)
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **@next/third-parties** for Google Analytics integration

## Architecture

### Calendar Logic

The application supports two calendar methodologies:

#### ISO 8601 Standard (lib/calendar.ts)
The default calendar system based on ISO 8601 standard:
- Weeks start on Monday
- First week of the year contains the first Thursday
- Uses date-fns functions: `getISOWeek`, `getISOWeekYear`, `startOfISOWeek`, `endOfISOWeek`

**Key interfaces:**
- `CalendarDay`: Represents a single day with ISO week info, holiday status, and display flags
- `CalendarWeek`: Contains week number and array of 7 CalendarDay objects
- `CalendarMonth`: Contains month metadata and array of CalendarWeek objects

**Critical function:** `getMonthWeeks(year, month)` groups days by ISO week number and ensures all weeks have exactly 7 days (fills in days from adjacent months as needed).

#### GfK Period Mapping (lib/gfk-calendar.ts)
Alternative methodology for retail and marketing analytics:
- Each month has a fixed number of weeks: 4 or 5
- Quarterly pattern: 5-4-4, 4-5-4, 4-4-5, 5-4-4
- Year starts on first Monday using ISO 8601 logic (first week contains first Thursday)
- Uses `startOfWeek(jan4, { weekStartsOn: 1 })` to determine GfK year start
- `getGfkMonthWeeks(year, month)` generates weeks based on fixed monthly allocation
- `getGfkYearMonths(year)` generates full year with GfK week numbering

**GfK month week allocation:**
```typescript
const GFK_MONTH_WEEKS = [
  5, 4, 4, // Q1: January(5), February(4), March(4)
  4, 5, 4, // Q2: April(4), May(5), June(4)
  4, 4, 5, // Q3: July(4), August(4), September(5)
  5, 4, 4, // Q4: October(5), November(4), December(4)
];
```

### State Management

#### Calendar Store (lib/stores/calendar-store.ts)
Zustand store manages calendar state and navigation:
- `mode`: "iso" | "gfk" - current calendar methodology
- `year`: number - currently displayed year
- `navigationVisible`: boolean - whether navigation should be shown in header
- `setMode(mode)`: Set specific mode
- `toggleMode()`: Switch between ISO and GfK
- `setYear(year)`: Change displayed year
- `setNavigationVisible(visible)`: Control header navigation visibility
- Persisted to localStorage with key: `fiscal-calendar-mode` (only mode is persisted, not year or navigationVisible)

#### Theme System (lib/stores/theme-store.ts)
Minimalist Zustand store for theme preference:
- `theme`: "light" | "dark" | "system" - user's theme choice
- `setTheme(theme)`: Update theme preference
- Persisted to localStorage with key: `fiscal-calendar-theme`
- Version: 0

**Architecture:**
- Store only tracks user preference, not computed values
- `systemTheme` is local state in ThemeProvider (not in Zustand)
- Automatic localStorage initialization on first visit
- Default: `"system"` - follows OS preference

**ThemeProvider (components/theme-provider.tsx):**
- Client-side component that applies theme to DOM
- Listens to OS theme changes via `matchMedia`
- Computes final theme: `resolvedTheme = theme === "system" ? systemTheme : theme`
- Applies `.dark` class to `<html>` element
- No hydration mismatch due to inline script in layout.tsx

**Initial Load (app/layout.tsx):**
- Inline script in `<head>` prevents flash of wrong theme
- Reads from localStorage on first paint (before React hydration)
- Falls back to system theme if no stored preference
- `suppressHydrationWarning` on `<html>` tag required

**Key Implementation Details:**
- No race conditions between Zustand persist and ThemeProvider
- ThemeProvider uses only local state for `systemTheme` (not Zustand)
- Zustand store only tracks user preference (`theme: "light" | "dark" | "system"`)
- User preference always persisted and respected
- System theme detection happens client-side only
- localStorage format: `{"state":{"theme":"system"},"version":0}`

### Holiday System (lib/holidays.ts)

Holidays are calculated dynamically for each year:
- **Fixed dates**: National holidays (New Year, Independence Day, etc.)
- **Calculated dates**:
  - Easter (Великдень) - uses Meeus algorithm (Julian calendar) in `getEasterDate()`
  - Trinity (Трійця) - 49 days after Easter
  - Black Friday - day after 4th Thursday in November
  - Cyber Monday - 3 days after Black Friday
  - Great Lent period (Великий піст) - 48 days before Easter

**Year range limitations:**
- Easter calculation valid for years 1900-2100 (constants: `EASTER_YEAR_MIN`, `EASTER_YEAR_MAX`)
- Returns `null` with console warning for years outside this range
- Provides graceful fallback instead of throwing exceptions
- Year navigation buttons automatically disabled at boundaries

**LRU Cache for performance:**
- Holidays cached per year to avoid expensive recalculation
- Maximum cache size: 5 years (current year ± 2 years typically)
- Prevents memory leaks from unlimited cache growth
- Cache evicts oldest entry when full (First In, First Out)
- Implementation in `getHolidaysForYear()` function

**Timezone handling:**
- All dates created in UTC with `createDate()` helper: `Date.UTC(year, month, day, 12, 0, 0, 0)`
- Prevents timezone-related bugs during calculations
- Easter algorithm converts Julian to Gregorian calendar (+13 days offset for 1900-2099)
- Consistent UTC usage across holiday system and upcoming holidays

**Holiday types** affect visual styling (defined in lib/constants/holiday-styles.ts):
- `national`: Blue gradient backgrounds, horizontal line indicator
- `religious`: Purple gradient backgrounds, horizontal line indicator
- `international`: Pink gradient backgrounds, horizontal line indicator
- `commercial`: Amber/yellow gradient backgrounds, horizontal line indicator
- `lent`: Subtle grey background for Great Lent period

All holiday styles include:
- Light mode: from-{color}-50 to {color}-100/80 gradient
- Dark mode: from-{color}-950/40 to {color}-900/50 gradient
- Consistent horizontal line indicators at bottom of day cell (w-2.5 h-0.5)

### Upcoming Holidays System (lib/upcoming-holidays.ts)

Helper utilities for finding and displaying upcoming holidays:

**Core functions:**
- `getTodayUTC()`: Returns current date in UTC for consistency with holiday calculations
- `getUpcomingHolidays(daysAhead)`: Finds holidays in next N days (default: 60 days)
- `groupConsecutiveLentDays()`: Groups Great Lent days into single period entry
- `getTodayHolidays()`: Returns holidays for current date

**Timezone consistency:**
- Uses `getTodayUTC()` helper to ensure UTC alignment
- Prevents timezone-related bugs when comparing with holiday dates
- All date comparisons done in UTC (12:00:00 noon)
- Matches timezone handling in `lib/holidays.ts`

**Performance optimizations:**
- Single `reduce()` operation for filtering and grouping
- Sorts holidays on-the-fly (no extra array copies)
- Efficient cross-year holiday lookup (handles year boundaries)

**Date formatting helpers:**
- `formatShortDate(date)`: Returns format like "9 січ"
- `formatPeriod(start, end, days)`: Returns format like "10 лют - 28 бер (47 днів)"
- `getDaysUntilHoliday(date)`: Calculates days remaining (0 = today, negative = past)
- `formatDaysUntil(days)`: Returns text like "сьогодні", "завтра", "через 5 днів"

### Styling Patterns

- Mobile-first responsive design with fixed-size month cards (285px)
- Auto-centered grid layout using CSS Grid with `auto-fit` and `minmax`
- Uses `aspect-square` for day cells to maintain consistent proportions
- Current month: slate ring border (`ring-2 ring-slate-300`)
- Current date: slate ring with lighter background
- Weekends: red/pink background tint (`bg-red-50/40`)
- Holidays: type-specific background colors with indicator shapes at bottom
- "Phantom" days (from other months):
  - ISO mode: very low opacity (`text-muted-foreground/30`)
  - GfK mode: normal styling with semibold font
- Sticky header with backdrop blur for modern glass effect
- Responsive padding using Tailwind's responsive utilities

### SEO and PWA Features

### Path Aliases

Configured in tsconfig.json:
- `@/*` maps to project root
- Import example: `import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"`

## UI Components

### shadcn/ui Components Used
Currently installed in `components/ui/`:
- `button.tsx` - Navigation and action buttons
- `badge.tsx` - Status indicators
- `card.tsx` - Month calendar containers
- `tooltip.tsx` - Holiday name tooltips
- `accordion.tsx` - FAQ section
- `dropdown-menu.tsx` - Theme switcher dropdown in header
- `switch.tsx` - Toggle switches
- `label.tsx` - Form labels

### Custom Components
Non-UI library components:
- `theme-provider.tsx` - Client-side theme application and system theme detection
- `theme-toggle.tsx` - Theme switcher UI component (uses dropdown-menu)
- `analytics.tsx` - Google Analytics integration wrapper (uses @next/third-parties)
- `calendar/year-navigation-controls.tsx` - Reusable year navigation with analytics tracking

### Adding New Components

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
```

Components are added to `components/ui/` with New York style variant.

## Key Features Implementation

### Dynamic Header Navigation
- Uses IntersectionObserver API to track visibility of main navigation
- When main navigation scrolls out of view, duplicates controls in header
- Optimized threshold: single value (0) instead of array for better performance
- Root margin: `-64px` to compensate for header height
- Smooth transitions with opacity and transform animations
- Responsive design: hidden on mobile (<lg), visible on desktop
- Prevents layout shift by maintaining header height
- Implemented in YearCalendar and Header components

### Mode Switching (ISO / GfK)
- Toggle buttons in YearNavigationControls component
- Zustand store persists mode selection
- Changes calendar generation logic dynamically
- Updates displayed week numbers
- Affects "phantom day" styling
- Analytics tracking on mode change

### Theme System
- Three modes: Light, Dark, System (follows OS preference)
- Zustand store persists user choice to localStorage
- ThemeProvider detects system theme changes in real-time
- Inline script in layout.tsx prevents FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)
- Theme applies via `.dark` class on `<html>` element
- No hydration mismatches due to proper SSR handling
- Dropdown menu in header for theme switching

### Scroll to Top Button
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for performance optimization
- Debounced state updates to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Circular progress indicator shows scroll percentage
- Appears after 300px scroll with smooth fade-in animation
- Smooth scroll animation to top
- Fixed position with z-index management
- Tailwind arbitrary values instead of inline styles for better optimization
- `will-change` property for optimized transitions

### Analytics (Google Analytics)
- Integration via @next/third-parties/google package
- Configured in components/analytics.tsx
- Only loads in production with NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID environment variable
- Custom event tracking in lib/analytics.ts with type-safe events:
  - `select_theme` - tracks theme changes
  - `navigate_year` - tracks year navigation (previous/next/current)
  - `select_calendar_mode` - tracks ISO/GfK mode switching
  - `outbound_click` - tracks social media link clicks
- Events tracked in YearNavigationControls component

**Error handling and resilience:**
- Wrapped in try/catch to prevent analytics errors from affecting UX
- Gracefully handles ad-blocker scenarios where `window.gtag` is undefined
- Development mode: logs events to console for debugging
- Production mode: silently ignores tracking failures

### Responsive Design
- Container uses responsive padding (px-8 to 3xl:px-96)
- Month cards fixed at 285px width
- Grid auto-centers using `justify-content: center`
- Font sizes scale with breakpoints (text-xs to text-sm)
- Header dynamic navigation hidden on mobile (<lg)
- Compact mode for navigation controls in header

## Docker Deployment

The project uses multi-stage Dockerfile optimized for Coolify deployment:
- Stage 1 (deps): Install dependencies including sharp for image processing
- Stage 2 (builder): Build with `output: "standalone"` (next.config.ts)
- Stage 3 (runner): Minimal production image, runs on port 3000

The standalone output significantly reduces Docker image size by only including necessary files.

## Additional Pages

The application includes legal and informational pages:
- `/privacy` - Privacy Policy page (app/privacy/page.tsx)
- `/terms` - Terms of Service page (app/terms/page.tsx)

Both pages are linked in the footer and included in sitemap.

## Environment Variables

Required for production:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` - Base URL for SEO features (sitemap, robots.txt, Open Graph)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` - Google Analytics Measurement ID (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)

Both are optional in development (safe fallbacks provided).

**URL validation (lib/env.ts):**
- `validateSiteUrl()` function validates and normalizes URLs
- Removes trailing slashes for consistency
- Catches invalid URLs and provides fallback: `http://localhost:3000`
- Console warnings in development mode for invalid URLs
- Production error if `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` not set

## Important Notes

- All text content is in Ukrainian (locale: `uk` from date-fns)
- Language code in layout.tsx: `lang="uk"`
- ISO 8601 week constant: `WEEKDAY_NAMES_SHORT` in lib/calendar.ts
- PWA icons automatically generated during build process via scripts/generate-icons.mjs
- Theme system uses inline script to prevent FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)
- localStorage keys: `fiscal-calendar-mode`, `fiscal-calendar-theme`
- `suppressHydrationWarning` on `<html>` tag required for theme system

**Timezone handling:**
- Holiday system uses UTC dates exclusively (`createDate()` helper)
- Upcoming holidays use `getTodayUTC()` for consistency
- All date comparisons done at 12:00:00 UTC to avoid timezone bugs
- UI displays use local timezone (browser default)

**Performance optimizations:**
- LRU cache for holidays (max 5 years) prevents memory leaks
- Memoized calendar calculations in components
- Selective Zustand selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- IntersectionObserver optimized (threshold: 0, rootMargin: -64px)
- ScrollToTop uses `requestAnimationFrame` with debounced updates
- MonthCalendar uses CSS containment (`contain: layout style`)

**Accessibility features:**
- Screen reader announcements for mode changes (aria-live)
- ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support (tab, Enter, Escape)
- Escape key closes tooltips
- Controlled tooltip state for mobile touch support
- Holiday tooltips with aria-describedby linking

**Error handling:**
- Easter calculation validates year range (1900-2100)
- Graceful fallbacks instead of throwing exceptions
- Analytics wrapped in try/catch (resilient to ad-blockers)
- Environment variable validation with console warnings
- TypeScript strict mode with proper type safety (no `any` types)
